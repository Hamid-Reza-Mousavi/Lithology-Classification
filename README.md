# Novel Approach for Lithology Prediction from Well-Logging Data Using Machine Learning And Deep Learning Techniques

Notes:
1. The code is written based on python 3. 
2. It is better than the mentioned packages for proper execution Use it in the requirements file (use venv and pip install -r requirements.txt).
3. XGBoost.ipynb only contains the XGBoost model.
4. Main.ipynb contains all models.
5. The Lithofacies_Classification folder contains the models and Functions used.
